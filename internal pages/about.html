        <h2>What's an emotion wheel?</h2>
        <p>Alexithymia is "the inability to identify and express or describe one's
            feelings"
            (<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/alexithymia">Merriam Webster</a>). It can affect anyone,
            and is not limited to a specific neurodivergency or mental disorder. Most people affected by alexithymia
            still feel
            emotions, they just struggle to express said emotions. Alexithymia is not currently recognized by the
            Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), but it is still something that affects many
            people of various neurodivergencies every day.<br><br>The concept of an emotion wheel is to assist those who
            have difficulty understanding and expressing their own
            emotions and to assist in self-reflection and awareness. There are many variations of the original emotion
            wheel <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-nature-of-emotions">created by Dr. Robert
                Plutchik</a>, and no single
            emotion wheel can fully capture the entire array of
            human emotions. It's aim is to simplify complex emotions down to basic words/components to help an
            individual navigate what exactly it is they are feeling in a given point in time, and use that knowledge to
            help improve their current conditions and/or state of mind.<br><br>
            This application currently uses a variation of the emotion wheel <a href="https://imgur.com/tCWChf6">created
                by
                Geoffrey Roberts</a></p>

        <h2>How do I use this app?</h2>
        <p>The first thing to do is select one of the main core emotions first shown to
            you. These are the main
            categories that you'll sort through to try and find the word for your current emotion. <br>
            From here, the app will start cycling through the emotions in that given category and displaying it to you
            in one of two buttons. The first button is your current selection, and the second button is the next
            relevant emotion. Select which of these two fits better. <br>
            If you want return to a previous selection, press
            the "go back". If you want to return all the way to the beginning, press the "reset" button.<br>
            Once the app has run out of emotions to display to you, it'll show your final selection!</p>
        <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
        <p>For a long time I've struggled with my own mental heal issues and self awareness. My anxiety has halted my
            abilities to express my own emotions to the point that I shut down the moment I start feeling anything
            remotely negative.
            My biggest hurdle was to just be able to express feelings, as it's <i>scarily</i> easy for me to block out
            any emotions due to previous trauma.<br>
            When I was first shown an emotion wheel by my therapist, I was excited to try a new tool to help me piece
            together the jumble of feelings I had at the time. However, I started having a new issue: having way too
            many options. Going from not having any words to explain what I was feeling to having too many to choose
            from was, to be frank, awful. But, I practiced and occasionally pulled out my emotion wheel when I needed a
            reference after a stressful battle trying to come up with words on my own. <br>
            Fast forward to this year, where I was looking for a pet project to work on in-between jobs and had an idea
            to simplify an emotion wheel down to its bare components. Show two emotions at a time. Don't worry about how
            well the colors fit, if there's multiple emotions, if one category fits more, etc etc. Just "this or
            that".<br>
            As of late 2023 I'm still in the progress of receiving feedback and working on improving this little app as
            much as possible, but I'm hopeful it'll have a good reception and I hope it helps out other folks as much as
            it helps me! :^)
