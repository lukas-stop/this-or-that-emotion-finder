    <h1>Tips for improving your wellbeing.</h1>

    A quick disclaimer: the following has been written using research, personal experience, and guidance from mental
    health professionals. I am not a mental health professional, I am a silly little programmer, and I <i>highly</i>
    encourage you to look up resources and do additional research on your symptoms and situation to better understand
    your physical and emotional needs. For this reason, I have made an entirely seperate page of this application
    dedicated to all the resources I could find. You can find this page at this link <a href="./resources.html">here</a>
    or via the navigation tab at the top.<br>

    This section is very long and descriptive. If you wish to jump to a particular section, you can do so using the
    links below.

    <p>You've been able to put a name to your emotion!! That's great news! Now comes the more difficult part, figuring
        out if you want to keep feeling those things or if you want to feel something else. This page is dedicated to
        tips and possible causes for negative emotions, and ways to help improve your mood.</p>

    <h2>Physical First</h2>
    <p>Your physical wellbeing can drastically affect your mood. If you're struggling to figure out the source of your
        emotions, a simple physical checkup may help. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Have I eaten recently?</h3>
            <p>Your body needs fuel! Especially fuel that is nutitious! Sometimes eating can be a hard task, so rather
                than whip out an entire meal try to focus on something light but still healthy. A light sandwich, some
                sliced fruit or veggies, or even canned soup are all really good, low effort options for a snack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Have I had anything to drink recently?</h3>
            <p>Water is just as important as food. If you've been crying, you've likely just spent a lot of your body's
                water. Even though hyrdation can come from multiple sources, you still should drink regular water as
                well
                (don't rely on just soda, coffee, or tea!). Have your favorite drink, preferrebly water or juice, and
                drink up.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Have I slept recently?</h3>
            <p>Look at the clock, what time is it? When did you wake up? Did you take a nap at some point in the day? I
                know it sounds silly, but sometimes just lying down for an hour or so can help give you a boost of
                energy. If you've been staying up super late the past few days, that may be burning too much of your
                body's energy resulting in a crummy mood. Dim your screens, put on your favorite music or something nice
                in the background if that's your thing, grab some cozy blankets and take a nap!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Have I stretched recently?</h3>
            <p>I hate exercize as much as the next guy. It's awful. It takes up free time. I don't like doing it. But
                without it I get joint pain. My back and hips hurt. I feel like an old grandpa, and you'd probably start
                feeling the same if you sit for as long as I usually do. You don't need to do a full work out, but doing
                super easy stretches like moving your arms around or standing up and walking for a little bit will help
                loosen stiff muscles and joints.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, remember to keep an eye on how consistently you take care of your physical wellbeing. Perfect
        records are hard to aim for, so instead ask yourself "What can I do right now to make myself feel a little bit
        better?"<br><br>
        For example, if you've been stuck in bed unable to gather some energy to get up and head to the bathroom to
        shower or brush your teeth, it might seem impossible to do anything else. Instead, let's focus on something very
        small. Can you lift your arms up over your head? How about stretching out your hands? Can you bend your legs and
        straighten them a few times? Hey look at you! You're stretching! What can we do next? How about get some new
        clothes on. Forget about making the bed, lets just put on something fresh. Bet that feels a bit cleaner now
        doesn't it?<br><br>
        This is a strategy I adopted a bit ago from a youtuber I admire, King Kogi, called "building a ladder". You
        don't need to reach the top of the ladder, but if you can at least climb up one step at a time that's something
        to celebrate! You're one step closer to success! <a

            if you have the time</a> to get more information on what it means to "build a ladder".</p>
    <h2>What's around you?</h2>
    <h3>Are my physical surroundings affecting me?</h3>
    <p>How clean is your current space? Take a look around and see if there's anything you can currently clean up. Dirty
        tissues, loose socks, a spilled drink. Start with smaller tasks and see where you can go from there. A clean
        space doesn't always mean a clean state of mind, but it can make you feel a bit more in control of what's around
        you.</p>
    <h3>Are the people around me affecting me?</h3>
    <p>Have you had a disagreement or argument with anyone recently? When someone in particular makes their presence
        known around you, do you feel this emotion more often? Sometimes things happen, and what was once a positive
        relationship has turned into one that makes you anxious just thinking about it. That's okay! Think about when
        you started having these emotions, and what situations might've causes these emotions to start happening. Are
        they a result of actions you did, or are they a result of something others did to you?
        <br>Talk with someone you trust, or reach out to a therapist to best work out the approach to dealing feelings
        towards others. Remember, if you have the option, to get multiple opinions as well! Don't jump to conclusions
        either. Piece together as much information as possible first, and asses how best to approach the person or
        persons afterward.
    </p>
    <h3>Is the world as a whole affecting me?</h3>
    <p>The world is scary right now. We are living in a time where it is <i>horribly</i> difficult to unplug from the
        atrocities and the painful reminders of what is happening in the world right now. It is easy to feel hopeless,
        even moreso to feel grief for things you might've seen happen to others. If you feel like it would be safer for
        you to turn off the news and look away, then do it. It is a very hard pill to swallow, and not everyone has the
        privilage to do so, but if you don't feel safe watching the news don't torture yourself by continuing to do so.
        Limit the news you view to a handful of sources you know and trust and block the rest until you feel comfortable
        enough to look into more resources. You cannot make the world a better place if you can't better yourself first.
    </p>

    <h2>How long have I been feeling this way?</h2>
    <p>How long you've been feeling an emotion can be a sign of an underlying mental or physical health issue. For
        instance, depression isn't always a deep feeling of hopelessness or sadness. It can be angry outbursts, hiding
        from others, purposefully exclusing yourself or constant feelings of worthless. Every person feels emotions in a
        unique way. Awareness of these differences has resulted in an explosion of exploration and reevaluating of the
        mental health field in recent years. That's why it's important that you are able to understand that you aren't
        just feeling "bad", and instead you are able to say maybe you're feeling "Overwhelmed" or "Hesitant".<br>
        Start tracking how many times you feel a particular emotion and that was happening about the same time as those
        emotions started appearing. If you're assigned female at birth (afab), see if these emotions line up with you
        menstral cycle. They may be a result of PMS! If you started a new medication recently, see if those feelings
        started appearing after you started taking that medication. It might be worth talking to your doctor if your
        medication is making you feel worse!<br>
        If you've found that your emotions don't have a particular start or end point, they may be a cause of an
        untreated mental disorder. Try reaching out to a therapist or psychiatrist to see if they can help pinpoint what
        exactly is causing you to feel these feelings!</p>
