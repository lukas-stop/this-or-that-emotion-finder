# this or that emotions
 an app that helps you narrow down what you're feeling

***NOTE: NO ACCESSIBILTY TESTING HAS BEEN DONE YET AS OF 11/13/23***

## Eventual implimentations
- jump to emotion (for when you know something specific but still want to narrow it down)
- physical pain checker (where on your body are you feeling these emotions?)
- resource list for personal wellbeing and safety links
- information/definition lists for each emotion (connect user to external dictionary so they can find examples, alternative definitions, and synonyms)
- text to speech availability for nonverbal/AAC communication
- record keeping ability so user cna regulate emotional wellbeing

## Current Accessiblity Issues
- buttons have no names + missing labels


## CURRENT PROGRESS/TODO LIST
- need to have a backup in case there are issues passing data through (fallback -> display selected emotion as the final emotion) - create the final emotion display function
