# This or That Emotions Finder
 This is a simple web app that helps you narrow down what you're feeling!  

## How to Use
First select one of the core emotions intially displayed to you.  These are the strongest emotions a person can feel.  Next, pick whether your original selection still fits strongly, or the next relevant emotion fits your current feelings better. If you want to change your mind, press the "go back" button and reselect the more fitting option. Once you've run out of emotions, your final selection will be displayed to you!

## TODOs/Eventual Implementations for future version
- Jump to emotion (for when you know something specific but still want to narrow it down)
- Add additional layers of emotions for larger emotion wheels.  Add features to change/replace the current emotion wheel being used.
- Add additional resource and advice pages under guidance of mental health professionals (how to safely navigate the emotion you named).
- Information/definitions for each emotion being displayed (helps with finding examples and understanding).
