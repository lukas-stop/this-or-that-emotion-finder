# This or That Emotions Finder
 An app that helps you narrow down what you're feeling!  This is based on the concept of an emotion wheel created by Robert Plutchik.

***LAST ACCESSIBILITY TESTING WAS BEEN DONE ON 11/20/23***

## Eventual implementations
- jump to emotion (for when you know something specific but still want to narrow it down)
- physical pain checker (where on your body are you feeling these emotions?)
- information/definition lists for each emotion (connect user to external dictionary so they can find examples, alternative definitions, and synonyms)
- text to speech availability for nonverbal/AAC communication
- record keeping ability so user cna regulate emotional wellbeing
- change which emotion wheel you are currently using

## Current Accessibility Issues
- buttons have no names + missing labels


## CURRENT PROGRESS/TODO LIST
- need to have a backup in case there are issues passing data through (fallback -> display selected emotion as the final emotion) - create the final emotion display function
- expand selection one more time to include sub sub emotions
- check accessibility features (buttons?  nav?)
- double check all current advice with mental health resources (reach out to some professors, doctors, and charities for relevant advice they recommend adding)
