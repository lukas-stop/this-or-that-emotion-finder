        <h1>This or That Emotion Finder</h1>
        <p>
            This is a tool created to behave as a <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/emotion-wheel/">simplified
                emotion wheel</a>. Some emotion wheels are very vauge, focusing more on core emotions, while others can
            be very lengthy and detailed. Many emotion/feeling wheels also use color to help the user navigate how they
            feel.</br></br>
            Alexithymia is the inability to identify and express or describe one's feelings (<a
                href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/alexithymia">Merriam Webster</a>). Emotion wheels are an
            excellent tool to help support those with alexithymia, however they can also be just as overwhelming. Going
            from not knowing what emotion to having so many emotions to pick from, at least in my personal experience,
            is incredibly stressful. I felt that if there was a way to narrow down options to a "this or that" format,
            it will allow myself and others to focus on smaller chunks of emotions at a time. It'll still require some
            thought to help figure out what emotion fits best, but less options will allow a user to focus on their
            feelings rather than the choices available to them!</br></br>
            One thing I also noticed is that many people associate color for different things. Think about how people
            may color code folders for subjects in elementary school; ever have debates on whether science should be
            red, blue, green or something else? For me, emotions are the same way. Yellow may be a happy emotion to me,
            but to someone else it can be seen as cowardly or negative. I chose to make this entire application as
            greyscale as possible (with some minor adjustments for accessability reasons) to help mitigate those
            confusions.</br></br>
            To use this application, begin by selecting one of the 7 core emotions. Next, pick whether your original
            selection still fits strongly, or the next relevant
            emotion fits your emotions better. If you want to change your mind, press the "go back" button and reselect
            the more fitting option. Once you've run out of emotions, your final selection will be displayed
            to you!</p>
